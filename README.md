## Concept & Rules

* This is a "guess the isogram" game.
* An isogram is a word with no repeating letters.
* The user has a limited number of guesses.
* After each guess the computer outputs...
  * Bull = right letter in the right place.
  * Cow = right letter in the wrong place.
* You win by guessing the word within max tries.
